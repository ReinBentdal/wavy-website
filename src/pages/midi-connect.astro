			<p>MIDI connect makes is super easy to manage your Bluetooth MIDI devices. Now you don’t have to menu dive every time you want to connect to your devices. It will also remember your devices and dynamically remember to auto-connect or not, similar to how the native Bluetooth menubar app on macOS handles your devices (headset, keyboard, etc).

				<!-- In addition the app has a built in tool to update your Wavy devices seamlessly.
				
				Note: For use with non Wavy devices, there is a unlimited free version. However every once in a while you will get a notification notifying you that its a free version. Upgrade to the paid version for €5.99 and you will no longer be bothered. Then you can use it with other Bluetooth MIDI devices just like with the Wavy devices. -->
