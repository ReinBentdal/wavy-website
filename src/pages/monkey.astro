                Monkey is a pocket sized Bluetooth MIDI keyboard. It has several
                built in unique MIDI effects, a drum machine and a looper.
                Monkey is optimised for low latency and low power consumption,
                enabling several months of usage without changing the battery. It connects to lots of hosts
                including macOS, OP-1F, ipadOS, Windows and Android.

                We believe Bluetooth has great unutilized potential. But we can
                not tap into this without making Bluetooth very easy and
                practical to use as well as providing high reliability. Monkey
                is our first product which taps into this. From our perspective
                we don't see a bunch of Bluetooth-centric MIDI devices on the
                market. This is the core idea from where Monkey originates from:
                lets make a device which only connects via Bluetooth and explore
                which new form factors and workflows spores out of this idea.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                We love the idea of the entire process being almost
                unconscious with a low barrier to step into a creative world. This
                is also how we think about Monkey. Enabled by it's extremely low
                power consumption we have the luxury to keep the device powered
                on at all times. It doesn't even have a power on/off
                button, it's always on.
            </p> -->
            <!-- <p>
                It's effects is made to be diverse, unique and unexpected. 

                You might then use it as a typical MIDI keyboard. But we take
                this exploratory idea a step further and include a bunch of MIDI
                effects. These effects are made to be diverse and unique,
                helping you come up with new and creative ideas. One of these
                effects is a drum machine, which combined with the built in
                looper makes it possible to make full fledged ideas completely
                on the monkey.
