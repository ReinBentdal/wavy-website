                Monkey is a pocket sized Bluetooth MIDI keyboard. It has several
                built in unique MIDI effects, a drum machine and a looper.
                Monkey is optimised for low latency and low power consumption,
                enabling several months of usage. It connects to lots of hosts
                including macOS, OP-1, ipadOS, Windows and Android.
            </p>

                We believe Bluetooth has great unutilized potential. But we can
                not tap into this without making Bluetooth very easy and
                practical to use as well as providing high reliability. Monkey
                is our first product which taps into this. From our perspective
                we don't see a bunch of Bluetooth-centric MIDI devices on the
                market. This is the core idea from where Monkey originates from:
                lets make a device which only connects via Bluetooth and explore
                which new form factors and workflows spores out of this origin.
            </p>
            <p>
                We had this thought: lets imagine having a guitar placed in the
                living room. One scenario where its stored inside it's case and
                where its outside it's case. Picking up the guitar which is
                outside its case can almost be unconscious and you are in a
                exploratory state of mind. If the guitar is inside it's case you
                have to make a conscious decision to take it out and start
                playing. We love the idea of the entire process being almost
                unconscious with low barrier to step into a creative world. This
                is also how we think about Monkey. Enabled by it's extremely low
                power consumption we have the luxury to keep the device powered
                on at all times. Actually it doesn't even have a power on/off
                feature, it's always on. Then you might pick it up at any
                moment, in the studio, in your couch or whatever, and start
                playing around.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might then use it as a typical MIDI keyboard. But we take
                this exploratory idea a step further and include a bunch of MIDI
                effects. These effects are made to be diverse and unique,
                helping you come up with new and creative ideas. One of these
                effects is a drum machine, which combined with the built in
                looper makes it possible to make full fledged ideas completely
                on the monkey.
            </p>
            <p>
                We provide a tool named <a href="/midi-connect" >MIDI Connect</a>. While monkey
                works with a bunch of hosts, we currently have best support for
                macOS. This tool makes it even easier to manage you Bluetooth
                MIDI devices and with the extra option to automatically
                connecting to your devices. Similar to how Bluetooth audio
                headsets automatically connects.
